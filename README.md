# Hi, I'm Leah.

I'm a **data scientist, mathematician, and researcher** working at the intersection of environmental science, data, and software. My work focuses on using mathematical and statistical methods to make sense of complex environmental systems. 

I am currently at **Air Quality Data Scientist** at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [(CDPHE GitHub)](https://github.com/leahgibsonCDPHE). About 80% of my programming is done on that account for work, and all the repositories are private. However, I want to highlight some of my own open source projects and contributions.

## Open Source Projects
 
#### [pmf2speciate](https://github.com/leahgibson/pmf2speciate)
Automated mapping of esat Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) profiles to EPA SPECIATE emission sources using machine learning

#### [runlytics](https://github.com/leahgibson/runlytics)
Started as an N=1 analysis of my running efficiency before and after heat adaptation, using my own training data, and ended with a 50k race plus some solid insights along the way. See write-ups on my blog: [We got a runner](https://open.substack.com/pub/polarvertex/p/we-got-a-runner?r=394csb&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false), [Regression on the Run](https://open.substack.com/pub/polarvertex/p/regression-on-the-runr=394csb&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false), [Running the Numbers](https://open.substack.com/pub/polarvertex/p/running-the-numbers?r=394csb&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false). 

#### [sailnet_pops_data_analysis](https://github.com/leahgibson/sailnet_pops_data_analysis)
Data analysis tools for analysis of POPS SAIL-Net data, integrating and visualizing aerosol data from a 1.5-year DOE-funded field campaign.

#### [ACT](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT) (contributor)
Enhanced visualization capabilities and added corresponding unit tests to improve functionality and reliability.

#### [sai-simulator](https://github.com/Reflective-org/sai-simulator) (contributor)
Implemented a CLI-based subset download feature for a 140 GB dataset and expanded visualization support for climate model outputs.

#### [esat](https://github.com/quanted/esat) (contribuutor)
Identified and fixed a bug in the package while using it for source apportionment analysis.
